I am an imaging researcher specializing in medical imaging and  video data, including MRI, PET, mammography, and CT scans. My work is deeply rooted in computer vision and deep learning, leveraging state-of-the-art AI models to enhance disease detection and diagnosis.
I employ cutting-edge AI techniques, such as attention-based models like Transformers, recurrent models like LSTMs, and advanced segmentation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model), to develop innovative solutions for medical imaging analysis. My primary goal is to advance non-invasive disease detection, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses that improve patient outcomes.
In addition to imaging research, I am also focused on developing secure and user-friendly medical applications that streamline patient data collection. By ensuring efficient and secure data acquisition, my work contributes to accelerating medical research and enhancing the development of AI-driven healthcare solutions.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the latest technologies and staying up to date with emerging tech trends. I also have a passion for reading books, engaging in creative crafts, and traveling to discover new places and experiences.
