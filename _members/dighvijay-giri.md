I am a machine learning engineer specializing in data and model curation for medical image processing. My work involves automating data-related tasks and developing interpretable machine learning models using radiomic features extracted from medical images. In my free time, I enjoy consuming stories across various media, including books, movies, TV shows, and video games. I also love hiking and film photography!
