I am a data science researcher with expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision, focusing on medical imaging applications. My work involves developing multimodal deep learning pipelines for cancer detection and optimizing end-to-end AI workflows for radiology. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, gardening, and listening to music as a way to unwind and stay creative.
