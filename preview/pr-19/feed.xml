<p>Meeting April Krueger at the Wyeth Krueger Symposium held at UC Davis was truly inspiring. As the courageous lead plaintiff in the landmark Krueger v. Wyeth, Inc. case, April stood up against Wyeth Pharmaceuticals for misrepresenting the safety of their hormone replacement therapy drugs. The funds received from this case have greatly supported my research and research across multiple institutions in California, driving significant progress in the area of women’s health.  Throughout the symposium, April openly shared he r powerful story and deep commitment to advancing research and awareness, creating a meaningful space for everyone dedicated to improving women’s health.</p>
