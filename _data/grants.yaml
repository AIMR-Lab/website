    title: "Large-scale harmonization and integration of multi-modal ADNI data for the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias"
    goals: |
      We aim to harmonize and aggregate trans-national cohorts of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to improve early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. In doing so, we gain deeper insight into the mechanisms driving pathogenesis, paving the way for better clinical tools and more efficient allocation of future disease-modifying therapies.

    title: "Leveraging Radiomics and Artificial Intelligence for Early Breast Cancer Detection Using Mammograms"
    goals: |
      Integrate advanced image processing, AI, and statistical modeling to derive a “pre-malignancy index (PMI).” By leveraging PMI, we can create a digital twin for breast health, incorporating family history, lifestyle factors, genotype, and phenotype to forecast breast health trajectories and model interventions aimed at minimizing breast cancer risk.

    goals: |
      • Evaluate the feasibility of using robust, reproducible, and repeatable (RRR) metrics extracted from a novel CT-based radiomics phantom as a feature-reduction technique.
      • Assess performance on clinical datasets for tissue characterization.
      • Investigate methods to standardize non-RRR radiomic metrics from multiple institutions with diverse scan settings to improve performance and reduce variance.

    title: "Contrast Enhanced Mammography for Breast Cancer Detection in Women with Dense Breasts and High-Risk Status (CEMDR)"
    goals: |
      • Determine the best use of contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) for breast cancer detection (stand-alone vs. combining with digital tomosynthesis, DBT).
      • Assess whether CEM or CEM+DBT can match MRI performance and gauge patient preference between CEM and MRI.
      • Use novel quantitative imaging and AI solutions to enhance CEM for detecting “invisible” high-risk tissue that predisposes to future interval cancers.
