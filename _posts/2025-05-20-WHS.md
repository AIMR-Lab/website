Research work titled AI-Enhanced Imaging Approaches for Breast Cancer Detextion in Mammography was presented at Women's Health Symposium, UC Davis Health by Dr. Bino Varghese.

Meeting April Krueger at the Wyeth Krueger Symposium held at UC Davis was truly inspiring. As the courageous lead plaintiff in the landmark Krueger v. Wyeth, Inc. case, April stood up against Wyeth Pharmaceuticals for misrepresenting the safety of their hormone replacement therapy drugs.
